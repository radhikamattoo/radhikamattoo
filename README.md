### Hi there 👋

My name is Radhika (she/her) and I'm a Software Engineer based in NYC. I'm passionate about backend architecture/engineering and database design!

### A little about me

- 🔭 I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at **[Behold.ai](https://www.behold.ai)**, a med-tech company that uses deep learning to recognize anomalies in medical images like Chest X-rays and CTs.
- 🌱 I’m very passionate about data privacy, [preventing the unethical use of AI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/07/fbi-ice-find-state-drivers-license-photos-are-gold-mine-facial-recognition-searches/), and breaking down the barrier to entry non-technical people face when it comes to understanding these  issues.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I own a 3-legged triple hound mix named Baby and she is just the sweetest, albiet a bit crazy.
